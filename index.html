                <h3 id="Objects">Objects</h3>
                <p>
                    In Evie everything is based on the consept of objects.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    To construct an object, you need at least one defined word (these can be keywords, already defined object names or both) and a non defined word.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    This non defined word is going to represent the name of that object.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Here's an example of what i mean:
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-cpp">
    type A  #Name of the object is 'A' and it's type is 'type'
    A B     #Name of the object is 'B' and it's type is 'A' 
    B ptr C #Name of the object is 'C' and it's type is 'B ptr'
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    
                    When the object has been defined the inheritted words are removed from the source code list ans only the name remains there.
                    The defined object is also pushed into the difinition list if the current scope.

                </p>

                <h3 id="Classes">Classes</h3>
                <p>
                    Now that everything has been parsed into objects.
                    The compiler looks for context so that it can start adding to the AST more complex structures.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    These complex structures contain classes.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    But how does the compiler tell apart classes from functions?
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    here is the syntax of both of them:

                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-cpp">
    int A{
        ..
    }
    int B(){

    }
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                    The above intails one class that inheriths int and is named 'A'.
                    The other one is a function that return int and is named 'B'.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The compiler tells them from apart by knowing which one takes what amount of paranthesis and what type'd are those parenthesis.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>


                </p>
                
                <h3 id="Base types">Base types</h3>
                <p>
                    In Evie there are no pre defined base types in the compiler source code.
                    But don't fret, you can make your own base types.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The compiler gives us access to modify some atributes of a sertain class.
                    These atributes are: 
                    - format
                    Format can be integer or decimal.
                    - size
                    Size tell's the compiler what size is the class in guestion.
                    The Size is expressed in bytes.

                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-cpp">
    type integer{
        size = 4
        format = integer
    }
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                    The current implementation of the base types are located in STD/Types.e


                </p>

                <h3 id="Functions imports">Functions imports</h3>
                <p>
                    When a function is imported the return type and the parameters are represented as integers and with decimal or integer word to represent the format.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    When the parser phase has gone by and the post-prosessor phase has began. The shattered information of the parameters and return types size and format are combined.
                    
                </p>

                <h3 id="File include">File include</h3>
                <p>
                    File including is another advanced feature in Evie.
                    The file include system can import functions from:
                    <br/>
                    - Dll files
                    <br/>
                    - Lib files
                    <br/>
                    - Evie files
                    <br/>
                    - Assembly files
                    <br/>
                    - URL
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The system that handles these file includes is called Docker.
                    The Docker tell's the difference between those file types above by reading the magic number in the header of that file.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Normal and assembly files dont have any magic numbers, 
                    so for assembly files to work you need to put at the start of the assembly file this text:
                    <br/> 
                    "#analyze". 
                    <br/>
                    In the future, Docker is going to fix this need of "#analyze" at the start of the file by reading the file type from the file name, as well as the magic number in the header of that file.
                </p>

                <h3 id="Templates">Templates</h3>
                <p>
                    At Parser time the template functions and template classes are stored as template users. 
                    If however the template class is defined during a object definition, the template class will be copied and this copied version will be overwritten it's all template usages by the new template type.

                    <pre class="language-cpp">
                        <code>
    type A&ltT&gt{
        T ptr Member1 = Allocate&ltT&gt(123)
    }

    int main(){
        #at this X variable definition stage the template class has been copied,
        #and the copied version is going to be overwritten by the new template type.
        A&ltint&gt X.A()
        retrun X.Member1[0]
    }
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                    But if there is a function that is not inside a template type class, this template function is going to be copied after the parsing sequense at post-prosessor.
                    This because wemight not be able to tell what function to call if there are multiple function overloads.

                </p>

                <h3 id="Pointers">Pointers</h3>
                <p>
                    Pointers are yet another dynamic feature in Evie.
                    The compiler wrapr and un-wraps the pointer layers automatically for you.
                    <pre class="language-cpp">
                        <code>
        int Foo(int ptr X){
            #Here the pointer layer is automatically un-wrapped
            #and returned the value the pointer points to.
            return X
        }

        int ptr Bar(int X){
            #Here we load the address of the variable X and return the address.
            return X
        }
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    The compiler also supports wrapping and un-wrapping nested pointers.

                    <pre class="language-cpp">
                        <code>
        int Foo(int X){
            #This wont work because the second layer of loading loads nothing.
            #int ptr ptr ptr Y = X

            #This will work.
            int ptr Y = X

            #This in turn will work because you can un-wrap the pointers infinitely.
            int Z = Y


        }
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                    Every time you load an address of a certain variable, this will create a <div class="Link" onclick="Goto('Temporary value')">temporary value</div> that is usually passed to the loader.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    When the previous 'ptr' has caused a temporary value the next 'ptr' keyword can not operate.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    You can of course also do this and it is valid:

                    <pre class="language-cpp">
                        <code>
    int Foo(int X){
        int ptr A = X
        int ptr ptr B = A
        int ptr ptr ptr C = B
        int ptr ptr ptr ptr D = C

        #this will return the value of X
        return D
    }
                        </code>
                    </pre>
            
                </p>

                <h3 id="Preprosessor">Preprosessor</h3>
                <p>
                    The preprosessor in Evie offers us with compile time variables.
                    <br/>
                    Here is a list of the compile time variables:
                    <pre class="language-cpp">
                        <code>
    char ptr SOURCE_FILE            //This gives the name of the source file that is compiled.

    char ptr DESTINATION_FILE       //This gives the name of the file that the output is going to be written to.

    char ptr OS                     //This tells to witch operating system the code will be compiled. (win, unix)

    char ptr HOST_OS                //This tells in what operating system the compiler is running. (win, unix)

    char ptr ARCHITECTURE           //This gives the architecture that is used. (x86, arm)

    char ptr FORMAT                 //This gives the format that the output file is formatted to. (exe, dll, lib)

    int BYTES_MODE                  //This gives the max architecture bytes size. (8, 4, 2, 1) (8 is same as 64 and 4 is same as 32, etc)

    int true                        //This gives the value of true. (1)

    int false                       //This gives the value of false. (0)
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    The preprosessor also brings some useful tools, like preprosessor if statements.
                    <br/>
                    Here is an example:
                    <pre class="language-cpp">
                        <code>
    if (OS == "win")                    //check is this code is compiled in windows.
    {                  
        if (ARCHITECTURE == "x86")      //chek if the architecture is x86.
        {
            if (BYTES_MODE == 8)        //check if the architecture size can reach 64 bits.
            {
                if (FORMAT == "exe")    //check to what format the compiled code will be written to.
                {
                    #This is the code that will be executed if the preprosessor conditions are met.
                }
            }
        }
    }
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </p>

                <h3 id="Function pointers">Function pointters</h3>
                <p>
                    Function pointters are one of the dynamic features Evie has.

                    One of the main reasons i wanted to create this document.
                    You see, function pointters in Evie are not same as in for example. C++.

                    First let's create some functions for our example.

                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-cpp">
    int Sum(int x, int y) {
        return x + y 
    }

    float Sum(float x, float y) {
        return x + y
    }
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                    We have to create a function pointters object:
                    
                    
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-cpp">
    func ptr A = Sum
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                    You may realize by now that something doesn't seem right. 
                    And you are right, this is where Evie will differ from most programming languages.

                    Byt how does this even work? Well it doesn't (:

                    For this to work the assing operator to needs to find the right suitable function to get it's address loaded,
                    this happends when you call the function pointter.

                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-cpp">
    int Result = A(1, 2)
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                    Think what just happened like this.
                    The name 'Sum' represents all functions that are named 'Sum'.
                    This 'Sum' is like a branch and the different function overloads are like leaves on that branch.
                    By calling the function pointter we state what leave from the branch we want to call.

                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-cpp">
    #this is where we tell function pointter A points into function branch 'Sum'. 
    #But no address is loaded yet.
    func ptr A = Sum  
    
    #Now we fetch the function from the branch we just set earlier.
    int Result = A(1, 2)
    
    #At this point we know that the function we load is the 'int Sum(int, int)'.
    #Now we go back to the load moment and set the right function overload.

                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </p>

                <h3 id="Temporary value">Temporary value</h3>
                <p>
                    A temporary value represents a value that has been loaded into a register.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Where can this temporary value be generated?
                    <br/>
                    Here is an example:
                    <pre class="language-cpp">
                        <code>
    func Foo(int x, int y){
        int a = x + y
    }
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                    Here the 'x + y' are first added together this summed value is stored into a register. This register can act as a temporary value.
                    As you already might know you cannot load a registers address, simply because they do not have a memory location that we can access.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    And that is why you cannot load a temporary value in a scenario like this here:
                    <pre class="language-cpp">
                        <code>
    func Foo1(int x){
        int ptr a = x
    }

    func Foo2(int x){
        int ptr ptr a = x
    }

                    In the function Foo1, the 'x' address is loaded into a register, and it is stored into the pointer 'a'.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    But in Foo2, the address of 'x' is first loaded into a register,
                    This register is going to be loaded as it would have a memory address, but it does not.
                    And this creates a big problem when you try to load a variable address multiple times in a row.

                <p>
                    Const is a internal feature of Evie, the workings of a consted variable is basically the same thing as a const in C++.
                    <br/>
                    In other words, a consted variable is a variable that can not be changed after initialization.
                    <br/>
                    Here is an example:
                    <pre class="language-cpp">
                        <code>
    type int{
        size = 4
    }
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    In the example above the class int is created with a size of 4 bytes.
                    <br/>
                    This size variable is an actual member inside the int class, 
                    <br/>
                    the difference is that the size variable cannot be changed after initializing the value of 4 to it.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Same applies to strings that point to a data section.
                    <br/>
                    Here is an example:
                    <pre class="language-cpp">
                        <code>
    char ptr Foo = "ABCDEFG"
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    In the example above the string is first made it's own label in the data section with it's data that is the "ABCDEFG" string.
                    <br/>
                    After the string is made it's own label, the assing operator right side is a pointer to that label.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    This pointer is usually named like this: 'S0', 'S1', 'S2' etc.
                    <br/>
                    This pointer to the label is a const char ptr that cannot be changed.
                </p>

                <h3 id="Static meaning">Static meaning</h3>
                <p>
                    Static is same as in C++. Where a static variable is declared once and it's value is the same for all instances of the class.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Namespaces are just classes that are static typed. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    A static class gives all it's members the static keyword, making all of them static.
                    <br/>
                    Here is an example:
                    <pre class="language-cpp">
                        <code>
    static Foo{
        int x = 1
        int y = 2
    }
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    In the example above the Foo class is static. This makes the Foo class a namespace.
                    <br/>
                    This means that members x and y are also inheriting static keyword.
