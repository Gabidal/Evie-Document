                    Function pointters are one of the dynamic features Evie has.

                    One of the main reasons i wanted to create this document.
                    You see, function pointters in Evie are not same as in for example. C++.

                    First let's create some functions for our example.

                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-cpp">
    int Sum(int x, int y) {
        return x + y 
    }

    float Sum(float x, float y) {
        return x + y
    }
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                    We have to create a function pointters object:
                    
                    
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-cpp">
    func ptr A = Sum
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                    You may realize by now that something doesn't seem right. 
                    And you are right, this is where Evie will differ from most programming languages.

                    Byt how does this even work? Well it doesn't (:

                    For this to work the assing operator to needs to find the right suitable function to get it's address loaded,
                    this happends when you call the function pointter.

                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-cpp">
    int Result = A(1, 2)
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                    Think what just happened like this.
                    The name 'Sum' represents all functions that are named 'Sum'.
                    This 'Sum' is like a branch and the different function overloads are like leaves on that branch.
                    By calling the function pointter we state what leave from the branch we want to call.

                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-cpp">
    #this is where we tell function pointter A points into function branch 'Sum'. 
    #But no address is loaded yet.
    func ptr A = Sum  
    
    #Now we fetch the function from the branch we just set earlier.
    int Result = A(1, 2)
    
    #At this point we know that the function we load is the 'int Sum(int, int)'.
    #Now we go back and tot he load moment and set the right function overload.

                        </code>
